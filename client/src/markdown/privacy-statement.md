We at %SITENAME% value your privacy as a roleplayer and content creator. To preserve it, we have taken several steps. We ask only for the bare minimum personal information needed, and do not use any third-party services that could track you.


### Personal data

During sign-up, we only ask for your email address and password.

Your password is not stored on our server directly; as is standard practice, for the purposes of checking your password at login, we store a partially randomized value (salted hash) derived from it. Even the server administrator cannot recover your original password. As is the norm for modern websites, all data sent by your browser is transmitted over an encrypted connection (HTTPS) and cannot be read by anyone except the %SITENAME% server itself.

We will never ask for your password by email or on Discord. If you ever receive an email or chat message that requests your password, please <router-link to="/contact">let us know</router-link>, so we can investigate the source of the message.

Your email address is only stored for the purposes of sending essential email messages from the %SITENAME% server, such as password reset confirmations.

None of your personal data is algorithmically analyzed or shared with any third parties.


### Anonymity

Other users cannot see your email address, only your character name. Furthermore, if you have multiple FFXIV characters registered on the same %SITENAME% user account, other users have no means of knowing that; they can only see characters and their associated content, not these characters' relation to user accounts.


### Image uploads

As a privacy measure, images uploaded to %SITENAME% by users have [all metadata stripped away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_removal_tool), including potentially personally identifying information like the name of the application that saved the image, and for photos, camera model, date and time the photo was taken, and GPS location data. None of this metadata is present in uploaded copies of the images stored on the %SITENAME% server.


### Cookies and tracking

The only personal data that the %SITENAME% website stores in your browser is an essential, anonymous session identifier for the purposes of keeping you logged in between browser restarts. These are stored entirely on the client side; the server does not maintain a list of active user logins, nor does it store a history of previous user logins.

Session identifiers expire in 30 days, at which point you need to log in again.

%SITENAME% does not contain any advertisements and does not install any third-party cookies, be it for tracking purposes or for analytics purposes.


### Server logs

Like most websites, for the purposes of quickly resolving potential technical issues, we maintain web server access logs, which can only be seen by the server administrator. Each log entry records the following information:

* Your IP address.
* Your web browser name, version, and operating system type.
* The address of the page requested.
* Time of access.
* The server response code (success or error).

These log entries are automatically deleted after 14 days. No user activity information is stored permanently or analyzed algorithmically.
