Welcome to Chaos Archives! By registering your account, you agree to the following terms:

##### General

- Treat others with respect.
- Refrain from posting content that references real-life politics or religion.
- Refrain from posting content that promotes real-life racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry.
- Refrain from posting links that lead to <a id="nsfw-ref" href="/rules#nsfw">NSFW</a> sources or malware.

##### Out of Universe Content

Chaos Archives is a website made to promote and support Final Fantasy XIV roleplay. We allow both in-character content, such as character diaries, and out-of-character content, such as Discord contacts or explanations of roll systems. However, it should be relevant to FFXIV roleplaying. Chaos Archives is not a place to discuss raiding, levelling, and other gameplay aspects of FFXIV.

To preserve the fantasy atmosphere of the game, please refrain from posting real-life photographs. We do welcome artwork and screenshots. You can also upload all kinds of decorative picture elements for your profiles and stories, such as Free Company emblems, pictures of scrolls, and the like.

##### Politics, Religion, and Bigotry

The Chaos roleplay scene is diverse. Please stay civil and keep real-world political and religious disagreements out of Eorzea. Real-life racism, sexism, homophobia, and other material that is culturally offensive in the real world is forbidden.

(Note that this doesn’t include in-character racism and politics. Your character can well distrust a particular Eorzean race or be an avid proponent of an in-universe political ideology, for plenty of reasons! Nonetheless, if it’s part of the character description, there needs to be an extremely clear <a href="/rules#ic-ooc">IC/OOC</a> line.)


##### Art and Screenshots

You may not edit or use someone else's work without their permission. Any form of art and screenshots requires having their author credited by their name on whatever website/social media they use.

**Special note:** If the author in question hosts <a href="/rules#nsfw">NSFW</a> art/photography, state this in the credits and refrain from embedding a link.

If the artwork or screenshot is made by you, the uploader, do state such in the credits.


##### Sexual and Violent Content

Remember that the game is <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/29479/FINAL+FANTASY+XIV/" target="_blank">rated T by ESRB <i class="notranslate material-icons q-icon external-link-icon">launch</i></a>, and not all FFXIV players, nor all roleplayers, are over 18 years old. Refrain from posting or linking NSFW* content in both text and art/edited photographic forms — keep the site free of nudity and extreme depictions of sexual acts, violence, and gore.


##### Admin Team

The admin team holds the power to remove any and all content for any reason.

In case of a rule's violation, warnings will be given out depending on the severity of the rule/s that were broken, though some cases might lead to a direct ban. The length of the ban follows the same formula as the warnings.
