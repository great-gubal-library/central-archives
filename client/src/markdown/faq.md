### FAQ

**Is the information on %SITENAME% public in-universe?**

Only if you choose it to be. The profiles here are intended for the players' OOC use first and foremost. Different players have different ideas of how public their character information is, and it's best to ask first if their character profile is an in-universe document your character could conceivably read. And there is no in-universe repository actually called "%SITENAME%"; Eorzean politics being what they are, it is hard to conceive of records for all Eorzeans of note being stored in one centralized place.
